# Huffman-rs

This is a code base to help compress text using huffman coding. 

## What is huffman coding?

Huffman coding is the smallest, single character compression algorithim. This implementation is based on the [video on the subject by Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsTptu56GM8). 

**Tl;Dr:** huffman-coding is a way of assigning the most effective set of bits to a character to get the smallest posible file sizes without multi-character compression.
